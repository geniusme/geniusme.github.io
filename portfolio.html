									<p>Athletrak is a database driven desktop and mobile application that serves to bridge the gap between Gym membership owners, physical trainers, and gym owners. The product features dynamic calendering, graphing, charting, and multi-level administration privileges. The premise was to offer a new option besides paying a large lump sum for one-on-one attention from a trainer. Instead, a single trainer can now help several people at the same time, creating custom diet plans and exercise plans, online, for their clients. <br><i>Technologies: PHP, jQuery, HighCharts.js, jQmobi, SQL</i> <a target="_blank" href="http://myathletrack.com/">&nbsp;Website &raquo;</a></p>

									<h4>IndieGoHalfsies.com</h4>
									<p>IndieGoHalfsies was a start-up weekend product, giving Aaron DuChateau of GeniusMediaSolutions.com a third place finish in the overall competition. The overall premise was to take HTML5 CANVAS games, and port them over to mobile devices, while integrating an advertising API. This allows Independent game developers to bring a game they have already put time and energy into, into a completely new market (Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone) that they were previously barred from. The product was particularly well received by entrepreneur Tyler Menezes Co-founder, TapIn.tv , who's interest in the product helped us to place third in the competition.<a target="_blank" href="http://indiegohalfsies.com/">&nbsp;Website &raquo;</a></p>

									<h4>UO Duckstore</h4>
									<p>GeniusMediaSolutions designed and implemented a mobile campaign for the UO Duckstore, comprised of a QR code t-shirt and a mobile web app for it to follow. The app listed current scores, social media share and like buttons and specials running at the UO Duckstore. After our shirt extravaganza, we organized a QR code scavenger hunt as well. UO students from the Lundquist School of Business helped put together a street team and posters for promotion. It was a great collaboration between a lot of helping hands that ended up being a blast to work on. <a target="_blank" href="http://uoduckstore.com/">&nbsp;Website &raquo;</a></p>
