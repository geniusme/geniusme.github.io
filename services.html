        <h4><i class="icon icon-ok"></i> PROFESSIONAL WEB DESIGN</h4>
        <p>The problem with website design is that average "web guy" knows nothing about marketing or actually getting YOU more customers.&nbsp; Without more customers, what's the point?&nbsp; You know you NEED to have a website to get more business but you'd better hire a "web guy" who knows HOW to get you more customers.</p>
<p>At Genius Media Solutions we know the objective of our client is to INCREASE THEIR BUSINESS.</p>
<p>That's why we design every site with only one goal in mind:&nbsp; To achieve a higher level of success for you, our client.</p>
<p>When we establish your piece of "virtual real-estate", we will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Research your market to find out what your competition is doing</li>
<li>Research your market to determine how to "talk" to your market</li>
<li>Structure your new website to be search engine friendly from the start</li>
</ul>
<p>… all the while we create a website that's professional and beautiful. Our end goal is to have you take as much pride in your new website as we do.</p>
<p>If you have a "Genius" build your website, we will…..</p>
<ul>
<li>Come to your place of business to meet and determine your needs and wants.</li>
<li>Develop a strategic plan with you involving your new website</li>
<li>Help you in implementing the website into your existing marketing funnels, as well as helping you create new campaigns with your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>We then get to work.&nbsp; We will create a 'mock-up" website and once you approve the website and the "plan", we make it all happen.&nbsp; You'll be as much or as little involved as you desire.</p>

        <h4><i class="icon icon-random"></i> CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h4>
        <p>We build custom web applications, content management systems, online services and more. If you can dream it, we can build it.</p>
        <p>
Sometimes you need a more than just a web designer. We have you covered. We have created internet services that go beyond a static website. Full scale, dynamic, user managed content, membership sites, e-commerce and more. Integrating with payment gateways such as Authorize.net, cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3 storage and the mass email servers of Amazon's SES are all part of the job.</p>

<p>
When you need an Internet Development company, we would love to sit down and talk about your ideas. Checkout our <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> page for some examples.</p>
